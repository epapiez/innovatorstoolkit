          <p>I am currently a senior at Michigan, and I am in the School of Information. I have minors in Entrepreneurship, STS (Science, Technology, and Society), and Polish.
            When I entered college, I did not really know what I wanted to do. I started off on track to be an Architecture major, but quickly realized it was not for me. At the same time, I took
          an introductory coding class and realized that technology would allow me to be both creative and analytical. I struggled deciding between Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Information, but finally
          settled on the School of Information after realizing the class sizes were smaller and I could take both data analytics classes as well as user experience design classes. </p>

          <p>I am most heavily involved in the Panhellenic Association, where I previously served as the Vice President of Internal Relations. I have also held a variety of
          other positions within my sorority chapter, including Panhellenic Delegate, Graphic Design Chair, Bid Day Committee, Senior Experience Chair, and more. The reason for this
          is that I am very passionate of women's empowerment and confidence. As a female in STEM, supporting and empowering other women in extremely important. Freshman year, I 
          was also in the Women in Science and Engineering Residence Program. There, I met my best friends and learned how important it is to have diversity in STEM fields. I also 
          learned that it is important to be confident in sharing your ideas and being proud of your accomplishments. In my free time, I also love to do yoga, and am currently
          participating in a 30 day yoga challenge!</p>

          My dad is named Radek, my mom is named Marlena, and my sister is named Adela. My parents both immigrated from Poland, so we are very close to
            Polish culture, which is why I am also minoring in Polish. My family loves to go hiking and participate in other outdoor activities together.</p>

          <h4>Hello!</h4>
          <p>For my biography, I decided to create a website in HTML because I am in Information Analysis major and am going to work in Solutions Engineering after graduation, 
            so a big part of my college career has included creating websites and visuals. As you will find in the text to the left, I am very passionate about
          women in technology and female empowerment in general.</p>
